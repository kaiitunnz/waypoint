# Manager — integrate

A ticket is in `review_requested` with a PR at {{pr_url}}, or already in `merging`.
You are the **sole integrator** of {{trunk}} and the human is the **sole merge
authority**. Run the review-until-merge loop, then land the PR behind the
integration lease. Never merge on your own authority.

Because execution is strictly serial on your shared tree, this ticket is the only
one occupying it — no other lead is building while you rebase or merge, and
`{{branch}}` is the branch checked out in {{repo_dir}}.

## Review-until-merge loop (human gated)

1. Post the PR to the human as an **approval** inbox item (link, summary, CI
   state from `gh pr view {{pr_url}} --json state,statusCheckRollup`). You are
   `--wake-on-inbox`-subscribed, so the answer wakes you.
2. On the answer:
   - **request-changes** → transition `review_requested → revising`, then relay the
     feedback to the lead **durably** (versioned `{{ticket_channel}}` post + a
     content-free nudge — see `templates/manager/monitor.md`). The lead addresses it
     (`templates/tech-lead/address-review.md`), re-pushes, and re-posts `done`; you
     move `revising → review_requested` and re-post the gate on the new head.
   - **merge** → go to "Land the PR" below.
   - **abort / latency-timeout** → `review_requested → abandoned`, note it on the
     ticket, then reap the subtree and release the tree (the same steps as
     "Finalize" below — abandoning an on-tree ticket must return the tree to
     `{{trunk}}` and drop its branch, or the next delegate starts on a dead branch).
3. Loop until the human merges or aborts.

## Land the PR (only on a human merge decision)

Acquire the lease first — you are the only session that advances {{trunk}}:

```bash
waypoint manager lock acquire --owner {{manager_session_id}}      # --ttl-seconds defaults to the manifest
waypoint manager ticket transition {{ticket_id}} --to merging --pr-url {{pr_url}}
```

Reconcile against the PR before doing anything irreversible — a prior turn may have
already merged it:

```bash
gh pr view {{pr_url}} --json state,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup
# state == "MERGED" → the merge already happened; skip to Finalize.
```

**Rebase onto the advanced trunk, then merge**, in your tree where {{branch}} is
checked out:

```bash
git -C {{repo_dir}} checkout {{branch}}
git -C {{repo_dir}} fetch origin {{trunk}}
git -C {{repo_dir}} rebase origin/{{trunk}}
# Trivial conflicts only (lockfiles, generated files): resolve, `git add`, `git rebase --continue`.
# A SEMANTIC conflict → `git rebase --abort` and release the lease (`manager lock
#   release`). Transition `merging → revising` and relay the conflict to the lead,
#   which resumes on the branch already checked out in your tree — no new slot is
#   needed, this ticket already holds the tree. Do NOT hand-resolve logic yourself.
git -C {{repo_dir}} push --force-with-lease
```

Confirm CI is green if `require_ci_green`, then merge (only if not already
`MERGED`):

```bash
gh pr merge {{pr_url}} --squash --delete-branch   # or --auto so CI-gating never blocks a turn
```

## Release the lease on EVERY exit

Release whether you merged, deferred, bounced to `revising`, or blocked — the lease
must never leak:

```bash
waypoint manager lock release --owner {{manager_session_id}}
```

A dead owner's lease is recoverable only by `waypoint manager lock steal --owner
… ` **after the TTL expires**.

## Finalize

- **Full completion** → `merging → merged`. Terminal.
- **Partial completion** (`is_partial` true) → `merging → deferred`. Terminal.
  Spawn follow-up tickets for the unmet goals **only here**, once the subset has
  merged, with a deterministic id/dedup key so a re-run does not double-create:
  ```bash
  waypoint board post {{tickets_channel}} "<goal>" --key ticket:{{ticket_id}}-f1   # registry cell, like intake
  waypoint manager ticket add "follow-up: <goal>" --id {{ticket_id}}-f1 \
    --priority {{priority}} --dep {{ticket_id}}
  ```
- **CI red / needs human** → release lease, `merging → blocked`, escalate.
- **Semantic conflict** → released lease, `merging → revising` (above).

On any terminal for a ticket that reached the tree (`merged`/`deferred` here, or
`abandoned` from the abort path above), reap the ticket's whole subtree **after**
integration and free the tree for the next ticket. Scope to this ticket by its
recorded lead sid — reap the lead's descendants (their worker sub-worktrees prune
with them), then delete the lead itself, then return your tree to `{{trunk}}` and
drop the branch. Each step is guarded so it is a safe no-op for a ticket that never
got a branch or lead — a writer-died `blocked` from `spec_pending`, or a turn-1
spawn death that `delegate.md` already cleaned up:

```bash
lead=$(waypoint manager ticket show {{ticket_id}} | jq -r '.ticket.lead_session_id // empty')
if [ -n "$lead" ]; then
  for s in $(waypoint sessions list --spawned-by "$lead" --recursive | jq -r '.sessions[].id'); do
    waypoint sessions delete "$s" --force --prune-branches    # workers had sub-worktrees; prune them
  done
  waypoint sessions delete "$lead" --force      # the lead had no worktree (it shared your tree)
fi
git -C {{repo_dir}} checkout {{trunk}}
git -C {{repo_dir}} pull --ff-only origin {{trunk}}           # sync trunk (the just-merged commit, if any)
git -C {{repo_dir}} rev-parse --verify --quiet {{branch}} \
  && git -C {{repo_dir}} branch -D {{branch}} || true         # no-op if the branch was never cut / already dropped
```

Post a one-line outcome to your `{{org_channel}}` channel and return to
`templates/manager/loop-cycle.md`. The tree is back on `{{trunk}}`, so the next
`delegate` can proceed — and this is where the manager may redeploy the stack if the
project needs it, since the tree now reflects merged trunk.
