# Inbox — reach the human

The inbox is the one channel that reaches the **user**, not another session:
post a message they triage in the inbox UI, and optionally block until they
answer. Reach for it whenever a session needs a decision, a sign-off, or input
from the user before it can proceed — a risky action to confirm, a choice
between options, or just an FYI to surface. Answers live on the item and are
read back over the API; they are never injected into an agent's input. Run
`waypoint help` for exact flags.

## Post an item

`waypoint inbox post --json <file|->` — the body is JSON because an item is an
ordered list of typed **blocks**:

```json
{
  "subject": "Drop the legacy users table?",
  "from_session_id": "<your session id>",
  "blocks": [
    { "type": "markdown", "text": "The migration is ready. Details:\n- ..." },
    { "type": "question", "question": "Which rollout?",
      "options": [{ "label": "all at once" }, { "label": "canary first" }],
      "multi": false, "required": true },
    { "type": "approval", "prompt": "Run it against production?",
      "options": ["approve", "hold"], "required": true },
    { "type": "attachment", "ref": { "session_id": "<sid>", "attachment_id": "<id>" } }
  ]
}
```

An item **resolves** once every required question/approval block is answered; an
item with no required blocks is a pure FYI that resolves when the user reads it.
Post prints the created item (its `id` and per-block `id`s).

**Attach a local file** with repeatable `--attach PATH` instead of hand-authoring an
`attachment` block: `waypoint inbox post --json - --attach ./rfc.md`. Each file is
uploaded to the sender session (`--from-session-id`, `WAYPOINT_SESSION_ID`, or the
body's `from_session_id` — required when `--attach` is used) and spliced in as an
`attachment` block immediately before the first question/approval block (appended when
the item is non-interactive), preserving `--attach` order. The runtime pins each such
attachment against the item so the orphan sweep keeps it while the item exists;
deleting the item releases that pin. A `--attach` path that is missing or unreadable,
or an unresolvable JSON `attachment` ref, fails the post and creates no item.

## Block until the user decides

`waypoint inbox wait <item-id> [--until resolved|update] [--timeout 30m]` blocks
and prints `{"outcome", "item"}`. Exit codes let a shell chain branch:

- `0` — `resolved` (all required blocks answered) or `update` (first change past `--since`)
- `124` — `timeout`
- `3` — `gone` (the item was deleted)

`--until resolved` is the default (wait for the decision); `--until update` wakes
on the first change. It prefers the live stream and falls back to polling.

## Read the answer back

`waypoint inbox get <item-id>` returns the item with each block's `answer`
(`{"selected": [...]}` for a question, `{"decision": "..."}` for an approval) and
any `reply`; the requesting session reads the decision here and acts on it.
`waypoint inbox list` (status filter, search, load-more) enumerates items;
`answer`, `read`, and `delete` are the remaining scripting verbs — the UI is the
primary answer path.

## The pattern

Post → wait → get: `id=$(… inbox post --json body.json | jq -r .item.id)`, then
`waypoint inbox wait "$id" --until resolved`, then `waypoint inbox get "$id"` to
branch on the answer. Reserve it for decisions that genuinely need the user —
don't interrupt them for what the session can settle itself.
